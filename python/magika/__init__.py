"""Magika: AI-powered file type detection.

Magika uses a deep learning model to accurately detect file content types,
even for files with missing or misleading extensions.

Example usage:
    >>> from magika import Magika
    >>> m = Magika()
    >>> result = m.identify_bytes(b"# Hello\nprint('world')")
    >>> print(result.output.ct_label)
    'python'

Note: See MagikaResult.output.ct_label for the detected content type label,
and MagikaResult.output.score for the model's confidence score (0.0 to 1.0).
